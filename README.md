# learnOpenGL

This repository contains my work while learning **modern OpenGL** using **C++**.

The code and experiments here are primarily based on concepts from  
👉 https://learnopengl.com/

The goal is to build a solid understanding of how OpenGL works, including the graphics pipeline, shaders, and rendering fundamentals.

---

## Purpose

- Learn modern OpenGL concepts step by step
- Experiment with graphics programming techniques
- Gain hands-on experience with low-level rendering APIs
- Create a reference for revisiting OpenGL concepts in the future

This repository is for **learning and exploration**, not production use.

---

## Topics Covered

- OpenGL context creation
- Drawing basic geometry
- Vertex buffers and vertex array objects
- Shader programming (GLSL)
- Coordinate systems and transformations
- Textures
- Basic camera movement
- Lighting fundamentals (work in progress)

---

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- OpenGL
- A windowing/input library (e.g. GLFW)
- An OpenGL function loader (e.g. GLAD)

Setup and build steps depend on the platform and environment.
